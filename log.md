# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 3 January, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on adding an input field to mood-ring-interactive.

**Thoughts** Still need to be more comfortable with event handlers. This one is tricky because of the bundling and calling the twitter api.

### Day 2: 4 January, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Further work on adding an input field and submit button to mood-ring-interactive.

**Thoughts** Frustrating start because I can't seem to get this element working. More research online to work out how to get client-side and server-side talking.

### Day 3: 5 January, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Followed a tutorial to learn how to use WebFlow, a tool that takes a drag and drop approach to coding, kind of like PhotoShop.

**Thoughts** Makes it possible for designers to work on front-end tasks, although you still need a good understanding of html and css to be able to use it well. Worth exploring further.


### Day 4: 6 January, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Began work on a poetry site for a friend of mine, designing and building it in WebFlow.

**Thoughts** Really intuitive and easy to set up. WebFlow cuts down a lot of coding time and the need to set up a project through the command line. Down side is that I'm not getting those little green squares filled in on Github.


### Day 5: 7 January, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Played around with CSS animations on the home page of my friends website.

**Thoughts** Nice and straightforward, and is helping consolidate what I have previously learnt about animations and transitions.


### Day 6: 8 January, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Added hover interactions to home page elements on my friend's poetry site. A lot of fun!

**Thoughts** Good css animations are difficult to achieve and take a lot of time playing around through trial and error. Good styling is definitely an art I'd like to master.


### Day 7: 9 January, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Not a productive one. Spent a lot of time in Photoshop trying to convert pdfs into png images.

**Thoughts** I'd like to be good at everything, but sadly I'm not!


### Day 8: 10 January, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Created twitter-tweets repo and researched a bit more about using twitter apis. Also followed a tutorial on making pure css images.

**Thoughts** Still a bit to learn about using twitter apis. Would be good to be fluent with these. Making css images is more straightforward than I had thought.

### Day 11: 13 January, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Have been playing around with css images, watching tutorials and practicing.

**Thoughts** Practice makes perfect. Good to get more familiar and confident with straightforward styling.


### Day 14: 17 January, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Had a go at the new react-native todo app tutorial.

**Thoughts** Looked really interesting and I was keen to try something new, but I stalled with issues in Xcode which became too difficult to solve. Learnt a bit about mobile development in the process.


### Day 15: 18 January, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Made some cool animations using p5.js.

**Thoughts** p5.js is a library that does some of the background work for creating JavaScript animations. Also comes with it's own editor which you download.


### Day 16: 19 January, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More p5.js animations.

**Thoughts** p5.js is a library that does some of the background work for creating JavaScript animations. Also comes with it's own editor which you download.


### Day 17: 21 January, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Followed the Dash tutorial, Project 1: Build a Personal Website.

**Thoughts** margin: 0 auto; is a handy piece of code for centering content. It sets left and right margins to auto, top and bottom to zero.


### Day 18: 22 January, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Followed the Dash tutorial, Project 2: Build a Responsive Blog Theme.

**Thoughts**
@media (max-width: 500px) {
      body {
        background: red;
      }
    }
The media query sets up the condition for the nested css.


### Day 19: 23 January, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on single page poetry website. Added sections and a slider and links from navbar.

**Thoughts** Became more familiar with single page website structure and navigation.


### Day 20: 24 January, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More work on the poetry website. Learnt a lot about sliders today.

**Thoughts** Useful to use containers to group elements, and then style the container in terms of layout, particularly using flexbox.


### Day 22: 27 January, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Built an app that grants wishes, using express-generator.

**Thoughts** Got my head around handlebars again after not using it for a while. Layout.hbs presents the view, which is filled by index.hbs.

### Day 24: 29 January, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: More work on the app that grants wishes, setting up routes and layout using flexbox.

**Thoughts** Sometimes input type submit is better to use than a button.
