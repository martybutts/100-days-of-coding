# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 3 January, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on adding an input field to mood-ring-interactive.

**Thoughts** Still need to be more comfortable with event handlers. This one is tricky because of the bundling and calling the twitter api.

### Day 2: 4 January, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Further work on adding an input field and submit button to mood-ring-interactive.

**Thoughts** Frustrating start because I can't seem to get this element working. More research online to work out how to get client-side and server-side talking.

### Day 2: 4 January, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Followed a tutorial to learn how to use WebFlow, a tool that takes a drag and drop approach to coding, kind of like PhotoShop.

**Thoughts** Makes it possible for designers to work on front-end tasks, although you still need a good understanding of html and css to be able to use it well. Worth exploring further.
