# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 3 January, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on adding an input field to mood-ring-interactive.

**Thoughts** Still need to be more comfortable with event handlers. This one is tricky because of the bundling and calling the twitter api.

### Day 2: 4 January, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Further work on adding an input field and submit button to mood-ring-interactive.

**Thoughts** Frustrating start because I can't seem to get this element working. More research online to work out how to get client-side and server-side talking.

### Day 3: 5 January, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Followed a tutorial to learn how to use WebFlow, a tool that takes a drag and drop approach to coding, kind of like PhotoShop.

**Thoughts** Makes it possible for designers to work on front-end tasks, although you still need a good understanding of html and css to be able to use it well. Worth exploring further.


### Day 4: 6 January, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Began work on a poetry site for a friend of mine, designing and building it in WebFlow.

**Thoughts** Really intuitive and easy to set up. WebFlow cuts down a lot of coding time and the need to set up a project through the command line. Down side is that I'm not getting those little green squares filled in on Github.


### Day 5: 7 January, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Played around with CSS animations on the home page of my friends website.

**Thoughts** Nice and straightforward, and is helping consolidate what I have previously learnt about animations and transitions.
